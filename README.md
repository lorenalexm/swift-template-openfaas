# Swift Template for OpenFaaS

## Description

Allows the usage of Swift within OpenFaaS containers, offering support for the Swift Package Manager (SPM) to be used. This greatly widens what is possible within your Swift function while keeping your code at a minimum.

This template is based heavily on the work already in place by [Keiran Smith](https://github.com/affix) for using Swift within the OpenFaaS system. A fair portion of the code and basis for the Docker images were taken directly from [affix/openfaas-templates-affix](https://github.com/affix/openfaas-templates-affix).

## Usage

Usage of the Swift language template assumes that faas-cli is already installed on the development machine, for cli installation help please read the [documentation](https://docs.openfaas.com/cli/install/).

From the directory you want to house the function, enter the following commands in your terminal.

```bash
faas-cli template pull https://github.com/lorenalexm/swift-template-openfaas
faas-cli new {projectname} --lang swift
```

At this point you will have a directory which contains the _{projectname}.yml_ file, along with the template directory OpenFaaS needs for knowing how to build the image, and finally a _{projectname}_ directory which contains the _Handler.swift_ and _Package.swift_ files where you will flesh out your function.

The _handler.swift_ file houses by default a single function _process(with: String)_ returning a [String](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string), wrapped in the _Handler_ class.

The argument passed into _process(with: String)_ might be more than a basic [String](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string) object, and could even be  [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) presented to your function as a string; allowing you to use the [JSONDecoder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder) together with a [Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable) struct.

Once your function is fleshed out and ready for use, and keeping with the simplicity of OpenFaaS, simply issue the following command from the base directory of your function. This will build the image for the function, push it to your container registry, and send it off to your OpenFaaS installation.

```bash
faas-cli up -f {projectname}.yml
```

## Examples

##### Barebones

This function example does nothing more than return a success string with each request.

```swift
// Handler.swift
class Handler {
	func process(with args: String) -> String {
	    return "Success"
	}
}
```

##### Codable example

A slightly more in-depth example, making use of the [JSONDecoder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder) class and [Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable). A JSON request is posted to the function endpoint, the function takes this in as a string, decodes it to the person struct, and returns the name and age as a string.

```swift
// Handler.swift
import Foundation

struct Person: Codable {
	var name: String
	var age: Int
}

class Handler {
	func process(with args: String) -> String {
		guard let json = args.data(using: .utf8) else {
			return "Unable to encode string to data"
		}
		let decoder = JSONDecoder()
		if let person = try? decoder.decode(Person.self, from: json) {
			return "Hello \(person.name), you are \(person.age) years old."
		} else {
			return "Unable to decode string"
		}
	}
}
```

##### Package example

A final example, demonstrating use of the _Package.swift_ file, and the decoding and encoding of a struct from a JSON request. A single value will be passed into the function, and two will be returned; the original and the hashed value. Fetching of the required dependencies is handled when your function is built and sent to the OpenFaaS service, negating the need to pull them manually.

```swift
// Package.swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "Handler",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/alexaubry/ServerCrypto.git", from: "1.0.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "Handler",
            dependencies: ["Hash"])
    ]
)
```

```swift
// Handler.swift
import Foundation
import Hash

struct Message: Codable {
	var original: String
	var hashed: String?
}

class Handler {
	func process(with args: String) -> String {
		guard let json = args.data(using: .utf8) else {
			return "Unable to extract data from string"
		}
		let decoder = JSONDecoder()
		if var message = try? decoder.decode(Message.self, from: json) {
			let hasher = Hasher.md5
			if let hashed = try? hasher.makeHash(for: message.original.data(using: .utf8)!) {
				message.hashed = hashed.hexString
				let encoder = JSONEncoder()
				if let data = try? encoder.encode(message) {
					return String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)!
				} else {
					return "Unable to encode struct"
				}
			} else {
				return "Unable to generate hash"
			}
		} else {
			return "Unable to decode string"
		}
	}
}
```
